I'm a German teenager living in Sweden. Interested in Computer Science, Modern History, and anything that's related to those fields. 
In terms of programming, I’m currently interested in front-end web development, but I enjoy playing around with Python and Java too. I'm learning Java, and I'd be happy to collaborate on whatever project that doesn't exceed my capabilities.
