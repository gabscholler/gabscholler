I'm a German teenager living in Sweden. I'm interested in Computer Science, History, Philosophy, and anything that's related to those fields. 
In terms of programming, Iâ€™m mainly interested in front-end web development, but I enjoy playing around with Python and Java too. Currently learning Java, and I'd be happy to collaborate on whatever project that doesn't exceed my capabilities. 

You can always reach me by sending an email - gabscholler@gmail.com!
